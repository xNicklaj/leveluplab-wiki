# Game Design Document
## Core Concept
___ is a roguelite bullet hell where enemies siege you in waves. The player has to go through a number of room and each room has different wave, with the final wave of each room having a different effect / debuff.

The twist of the game is that each enemy has a different color of bullet, and each time the player is hit by a bullet of a specific color their movement scheme is shifted.

The player has to repeat the same level a number of time, and each time a cycle ends the player has the ability to choose a buff that will be active from the next cycle onwards, and a debuff that will be active only in the following cycle.

After some cycles, the player is faced with a boss battle that has the ability to use all the debuffs that the player has previously faced.

Moreover, each room has a different camera position that gives it an entire different feel. As example one room might have a top-down view, while another has a side scrolling view.

## Types of bullet

- Rosso bullets: these bullets reset the control scheme to default
- Yellow bullets: these bullets shift the color scheme to 90°.
- Purple bullets: these bullets shift the color scheme to -90°.
- Blue bullets: these bullets shift the color scheme to 180°.

## Buffs

## Debuffs
- Increase the size of the enemy bullets.
- Increase the speed of enemy bullets.
- Enemies have to be hit twice to be killed.
- Bullets color changes overtime.

## Inspirations and references used

The idea of the bossfight comes from references such as Mega Satan from The Binding of Isaac and Leshy from inscription.

Mega Satan becomes a very hard bullet hell that uses all the different effects that the player has previously used.
